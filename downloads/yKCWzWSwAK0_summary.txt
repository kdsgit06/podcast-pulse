        "React Compiler kind of just takes that away from developers.",
        "It's more shifting that responsibility to React itself.",
        "It's like, okay, we know that you often have to memoize stuff in your React components just due to the way that our rendering system works."

        "So I understand it's going to solve it kind of in an automatic way.",
        "The only additional thing now is like I have to actively say, okay, if I don't want React React compiler to kick in",
        "I like the idea of not having this cognitive load of rendering cycles and then figuring out what to use callback or use Memo for."

        "So first you might run NPX React Compiler health check.",
        "Then there's also the Islint plugin, and this is what most developers will use in their code base to Work with compiler",
        "But yeah, then, then it's just turning it on in your build pipeline."

      "quotes_advice": [
        "Especially on low end devices it will definitely make a big difference.",
        "I know for Instagram I believe they got like a 30% improvement just turning on compiling.",
        "So in that case you can run React code really fast if you're running it on for example like Hermes, stuff like that on mobile devices."

      "quotes_advice": [
        "I feel like eventually they might integrate it with other. It could be optimized for other kind of rendering engines as well.",
        "I feel like a lot of frameworks, they come and go, some stick a little bit, but React still stands tall, I feel like.",
        "No, I'm confident that React will only get better."

        "But still, the code that AI generates often for me is it's just not good."
